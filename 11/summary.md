"The transcript is a medical consultation where a 25-year-old patient presents with sharp chest pain lasting a few seconds, occurring intermittently over three days. The pain is localized over the heart area, worsens with coughing or lying down, and improves when leaning forward. The patient denies other symptoms like shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, or viral symptoms currently, though they had the flu a week prior. The patient has no significant past medical history, surgeries, or medication use except occasional Tylenol. Notably, the patient's father recently died of a heart attack two weeks ago, raising the patient's concern about having a heart attack. The patient is a student with a part-time job, lives with their mother, and has minimal alcohol use with no smoking or recreational drugs. The clinician plans to perform an ECG and possibly blood tests to evaluate the heart and reassures the patient while awaiting results."
